makeNumberPyramid function
1. Create formal parameter for the number of rows from the caller of the function
2. Create a string variable that will be returned. Start as an empty string.
3. Create a loop that creates a string for the bottom row and use the len() function to calculate the length
5. Create a loop from 0 to the number of rows (including the number of rows value)
     a. Create a string variable for the row of text
     b. Create a loop from 0 to the current row number
          i. Create a conditional to concatenate a space to the text if it's not the first character of the row
          ii. Concatenate the row number to the string
     c. Add the row of text string to the message variable centered at the length of the bottom row.
        Make sure to add a newline at the end
5. Return the string message
