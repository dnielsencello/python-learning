I fixed the error by account for the space there needs to be
on the bottom row and centering my text so it stacks like a
pyramid instead of a staircase

I fixed this by counting the length of the bottom row using
a for loop to create only the bottom string and then calculated
the length of the bottom string.

each concatenation of a row to the program was centered at that length.

Another problem that I found is that my for loop counts from 0 to the number
of rows +1 adding an unnecessary blank row in the code.
