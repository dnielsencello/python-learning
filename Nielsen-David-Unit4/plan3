Software Developement Plan 3

task3.py
    need to import pattern.py to access functions

1.main function
    Setup the screen to the proper size
    2. Implement a while loop that allows program to conitue
        while loop presents menu to user asking which mode they want to play

        2a. if user chooses option 1 then a rectangle pattern is initiated
        the user inputs number value for xy postions, offset, hieght
        width, rotation, and count.

        pattern.drawRectanglePattern is called with the user defined parameters

        2b. if user chooses option 2 then a circle pattern is initiated the user
        inputs xy positions, offset, radius, and count

        pattern.drawCirclePatter is called with the user defined parameters

        2c. if the user chooses option 3 a super pattern is initiated. The user
        can input the number of patterns to draw or the number is assigned randomly

        pattern.drawSuperPattern is called.

    After the pattern is done being made the user is prompted whether or not they
    will continue, keeping of clearing the drawings, or exiting
    ---------------------------------------------------------
        if response == 1:
            continue
        if response == 2:
            pattern.reset()
        if response == 3:
            playAgain = False
    -----------------------------------------------------------

pattern.py

1 Imported modules
math
from random randint
turtle

2 reset function
erase all patterns
call setup function

3 setup
sets turtle to speed 1000
adjust screensize

4 draw rectangle pattern
for loop sets parameters for draw rectangle function
newX, newY = location of the corner of each rectangle is determined by the number of
        rectangles in a circle
angle is used as the input for turtle.setheading it adjusts the rotation of each rectangle
drawRectangle is called to draw each rectangle in the loop

5 draw rectangle
setRandomColor function is called for each iteration of the loop
the rectangle is drawn using turtle

6 draw circle pattern
uses a for loop to draw all the circles in the pattern
sets a random color for each circle drawn in the pattern

7 draw super pattern
takes user input num to determine the number of patterns that will be drawn
choose randomly between a rectangle or circle pattern
sets parameters for either the draw rectangle pattern or draw circle pattern functions.

8 setRandomColor
sets turtle color randomly between red, purple, blue, green, or orange

9 done
calls turtle.done() function




pattern.py - You must define the following functions
 reset() - Erase all of the patterns and start over
 setup()
Configure turtle to draw quickly
Configure turtle to have a window of 1000 x 800
 drawRectanglePattern()
Use appropriate parameters
See additional information below
It should call drawRectangle()
drawRectangle()
Use appropriate parameters
Should draw a SINGLE rectangle
drawCirclePattern()
Use appropriate parameters
See additional information below
drawSuperPattern()
Use appropriate parameters
Randomly draw Rectangle and Circle patterns. Each pattern should based on random values.
Use reasonable random values (some can be negative) so patterns are drawn on the screen
setRandomColor()
Do not use any parameters
Set turtle to draw in a random color
Use at least 4 colors
done()
Called when user quits
Keeps the turtle window open
