chessboard.py

1 drawChessboard
    takes parameters: startX, startY, width, height
    width and height default parameters set to 250

2 drawAllRectangles
    variables
        width2 is the width of the chessboard divided by 8
        height2 is the height of the chessboard divided by 8
        startY2 = position for each small rectangle in the loop
        startX2 = position for each small rectangle in the loop

    for loop is used to determine the position of each rectangle in the first set
        calls drawRectangle with parameters (startX2, startY2, width2, height2)
    for loop is called again to determine positions for second set of rectangles
         calls drawRectangle with parameters (startX2, startY2, width2, height2)

3 drawRectangle
    draws rectangles
