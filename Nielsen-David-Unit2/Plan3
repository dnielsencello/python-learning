requirements
    Get input from user for number of sides and length each side of a regular polygon. Output the area of the polygon.
    Must use the following modules: tan(), math.pow(), pi. Output should be rounded to 5 decimal places using round()

System Analysis

area = (numsides*math.pow(sidelength,2))/(4*math.tan(math.pi/numsides))
area = round(area, 5)

System Design
    Import math modules.
    Prompt user for number of polygon sides
    Prompt user for side length
    Display Result of area calculation
Implementation - coding

Testing

C:\Users\DAVID\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\python.exe "C:/Users/DAVID/Documents/USU/CS 1400/Nielsen-David-Unit2/Task3.py"
How many sides does the polygon have?: 8
What is the length of each side of the polygon? 5
The area of the polygon is:  120.71068

Process finished with exit code 0
