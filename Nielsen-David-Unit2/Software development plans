Task 4

Displaying employee payment information

USER INPUTS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
    - Employee Name
    - Number of hours worked in a week

CACULATIONS
    totalPay = hoursWorked*hourlyPay
    fedWithholding = totalPay*fedWithhold*100

    totalDeduction = stateWithholding+fedWithholding
    netPay = totalPay - totalDeduction


CONSOLE OUTPUT

Most common concatenation statement to properly center the words
    Out += format("Pay Rate: $", ">30")
    Out += format(hourlyPay, ">10.2f")
    Out += "\n"
    Out += "\n"

Modified statements
    Out = format(Out, "^40")

    Out += format("Hours Worked:  ", ">30")
    Out += format(hoursWorked, ">10")

PRINT STATMENT
