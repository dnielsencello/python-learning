Elephants

# 1. Import statements
# 2. the program will ultimately ask the user if they would like to
   # to continue, therefore it will be in a while loop
# 3. we will check to see what stall each elephant will enter each night
# for loop from 1 to 10000
# elephant one will enter a stall
# elephant two will enter a stall
# zookeeper will check a stall
# Nested if statement
    # if the zookeeper sees elephant1 or elephant2 in a stall we will count
    # add it to a total
           # if the zookeeper sees that both elephants are in the stall we
           # will add it to a seperate total.

# 4. doing math
    #occurance1 = elephantInStall/100000
    #occurance2 = bothElephatsInStall/elephantInStall
# Print of the results
# Prompt user if they would like to continue
