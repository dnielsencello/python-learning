3. ask for personal space radius

CALCULATIONS
1. Calculate the distance between people
    distance = ((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2)**0.5
2. Based on output append to message.

d < r1 and d < r2
	- in each others space

	if r2 + d < r1:
		- two completely in one's space
	elif r1 + d < r2:
		- one completely in two's space
	else:
		- overlapping

d < r1 and d > r2 and

	if r2 + d < r1:
		- two completely in one's space
	elif r1 + d < r2:
		- one completely in two's space
	else:
		- overlapping

d > r1 and d > r2 and d > r1 + r2
	- not in each others space
	- spaces not overlapping
d > r1 and d > r2 and d < r1 + r2
	- not in each others space
	- spaces overlapping
