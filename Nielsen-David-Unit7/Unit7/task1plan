Prompt the user for the number of players. This does not include the dealer. You may have 1 - 5 players
Each player starts with $100 in their account
A player can continue until they are out of money
Each round (encase each round in a while loop)
    Prompt each player one at a time for their bet amount. (don't prompt if they don't have money)
    Display the current balance for each user as part of their prompt
    The minimum bet is $5 or their entire balance, whichever is lower
Deal the cards (new deck for each iteration of the while loop)
    Each round will have a fresh deck of shuffled cards
    Cards are dealt one at a time beginning with player 1 and ending with the dealer
    Each player (including the dealer) gets two cards, meaning there will be two cycles of dealing cards to each player.(this doesn't depend on input from users)
    After dealing all cards display the dealer's second card

4 lists
    account = amount of money for each player
    list1 =  the hand of each player (2 dimensional)
    list2 = the bet amount of each player
    list3 = the total of the card values within each players hand, updates each time a player draws a new card.

For each player starting with player 1
    Show the player hand
    Ask the player if they'd hit (take another card) or hold
    Repeat until they hold or bust (total of cards is over 21)
    If they bust they lose (move to next player if they bust)
    If the player holds then the next player goes

After all players are done the dealer complete its turn
    Display both dealer cards (print each on a new line)
    Use time.sleep() to wait for 1 second before dealing another card(s) to the dealer (I'll wait a little longer)
    The dealer must take a card until its total is 17 or higher
    If the dealer's initial hand is 17 or higher it does not take a card

    Use appropriate messages so the players know what the dealer is doing
Ex: "The dealer takes a card" / "The dealer busts" / "The dealer holds"

tons of if conditional statements to display outcomes
Determining winners
    If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players who did not bust win
    If the player and dealer totals are the same they tie
    If the players hand is lower than the dealer, the player loses
    Use appropriate messages to let each player know what their result is
Player payouts
    Win - add the amount bet to the player's balance
    Tie - neither add nor subtract from the player's balance
    Lose - subtract the amount bet from the player's balance
    Display each user's balance (including those who have lost all their money)
Ask to Play again
    Yes: Repeat the round for all players with a positive balance (skip past players who don't have a positive balance, manage list changes as necessary)
    No
        Print a Thank You message
        Print each player's name (their player number) and balance starting with the one with the highest. You should perform a sort first.
        perform a sort

Notes
This is not quite real blackjack.
    The player and dealer will not automatically win if they have Blackjack (21 on the first hand)
    There is no doubling down or insurance
Card values
    Numeric cards are worth the same number of points
    (Write a new function to be called in the main() function to specify card values)
    Ace is worth eleven points unless the total of all cards exceeds 21, then it is counted as one.
    Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points
    Use the full card name, not the nickname for this task
    Do not use variables for individual player data. You should use lists that are sized appropriately for the number of players selected
    Use a single multidimensional list to manage the hands for all players and the dealer
    Use other appropriate list(s) to manage the account balance for each player and wagers
    Use appropriate prompts so it is clear which player should be playing and what their options are
    Use appropriate messages so players know what is happening in the game
    You should not modify the card or deck files
